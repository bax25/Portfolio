    -   **Problem:** Tackled the challenge of variability in human handwriting to achieve near-perfect classification.
    -   **Solution:** Engineered a custom CNN with Keras/TensorFlow, achieving **99.2% accuracy** on the MNIST dataset.
    -   **Impact:** Demonstrates expertise in building and optimizing high-precision computer vision models.

-   **Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition:**
    -   **Problem:** Developed a system to improve road safety and provide critical data for autonomous driving systems.
    -   **Solution:** Trained a YOLOv5 model for real-time object detection and deployed it with a Streamlit web app.
    -   **Impact:** Created a scalable solution to assist drivers and enhance situational awareness.

-   **Automated Face Mask Detection:**
    -   **Problem:** Addressed public health needs by creating a tool to monitor safety compliance in public spaces.
    -   **Solution:** Combined Haar Cascades for face localization with a custom-trained CNN for classification.
    -   **Impact:** Built a real-time system capable of identifying mask usage in video streams with high accuracy.

-   **Legal Document Analysis with NER:**
    -   **Problem:** Solved information overload in the legal field by automating the extraction of key information.
    -   **Solution:** Fine-tuned a spaCy NER model on custom legal texts, achieving an **F1-score of 0.87**.
    -   **Impact:** Accelerated document review and analysis by programmatically identifying critical entities.

-   **Automated Image Captioning:**
    -   **Problem:** Bridged the gap between visual data and textual understanding to make content more accessible and searchable.
    -   **Solution:** Implemented an encoder-decoder model (CNN+RNN) to generate descriptive image captions.
    -   **Impact:** Created a versatile tool for digital asset management and assistive technologies.

-   **Customer Review Sentiment Analysis:**
    -   **Problem:** Extracted valuable business insights from unstructured text data like customer reviews.
    -   **Solution:** Fine-tuned a BERT model on the IMDB dataset, achieving **92% accuracy** for sentiment classification.
    -   **Impact:** Developed a powerful method for analyzing customer feedback, social media trends, and brand perception.
