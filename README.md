-   **Named Entity Recognition Pipeline:**
    A custom NER model fine-tuned with spaCy on legal documents, achieving an F1 score of 0.87 for entity extraction.

-   **Image Caption Generator:**
    An encoder-decoder model (CNN+RNN) that automatically generates descriptive captions for images.

-   **Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews:**
    A sentiment classification model using a fine-tuned BERT on the IMDB dataset, achieving 92% accuracy.
